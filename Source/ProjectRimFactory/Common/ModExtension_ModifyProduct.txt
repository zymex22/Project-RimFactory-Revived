 ModExtension_ModifyProduct
 A DefModExtension that allows you to add bonuses or otherwise modify bill products/trigger callbacks
   Note that while this was originally set up to provide bonus items for a factory mod, the possible
   uses are mostly limited by your imagination.
 Sample XML:
  ...
  <modExtensions>
    <li Class="[namespace].ModExtension_ModifyProducts">
      <doAll>true</doAll>   - whether to process all "bonuses"
      <bonuses>
        <li> - 1st child "bonus"
          <chance>.5</chance> - half the time
          <altChanger>MyMod.KillAllHumans</altChanger> - alternate callback; this one
                                             may not actually be considered a "bonus"
                                             See ProductChangerDel in the C#
        </li>
        <li><def>Gold</def><count>3</count></li> - automatically always add 3 gold
        <li>
          <replaceOrigProduct>true</replaceOrigProduct>    - we didn't want that gold anyway
          <bonusYields Chance="0.18">                  - an alternate way to specify bonus rewards:
            <ChunkSlagSteel Weight="1" Count="1" />    - 18% chance of something replacing the orig
            <Gold Weight="0.33" Count="10" />            product, with a weighted random choice of
            <Jade Weight="0.33" Count="10" />            slag, gold, jade, silver, or a sculpture
            <Silver Weight="0.33" Count="30" />
            <SculptureLarge Weight="0.01" Count="1" Quality="6" MaterialDef="Jade" />
          </bonusYields>
          <billBonusYields> - only works with bonusYields, I'm afraid.  If you get a bonus
            <li>              yield (as above), this has a chance to replace it with a 
              <key>Make_SculptureSmall</key>    - recipe-specific bonus item
              <value Chance="1"><ChunkSlagSteel Weight="1" Count="1" /> - no one likes small scupltures?
            </li>
          </billBonusYields>
        </li>
        <li>
          <chance>0.25</chance>       - 25% chance of either 1 gold or 1 silver (50% chance of either)
          <bonuses>
            <li><weight>1</weight><def>Gold</def></li>
            <li><weight>1</weight><def>Silver</def></li>
          </bonuses>
        </li>
        <li>
          <chance>0.25</chance>       - 25% chance of either 1 gold or 1 silver (50% chance of either)
          <bonuses>                   - (note: doAll is false by default)
            <li><chance>0.5</chance><def>gold</def></li>
            <li><def>Silver</def></li>  (note: chance defaults to 1)
          </bonuses>
       </li>
      </bonuses>
    </li>
    ...
C# Note:
If you make products but do not do so using the vanilla recipe bill product creation (GenRecipe's MakeRecipeProducts),
you can still use this by calling the DefModExtension directly:
this.def.GetModExtension<ModExtension_ModifyProduct>()?.ProcessProducts(tmpList, this as IBillGiver, this);

Note also: This can be expanded to add new fields fairly easily.  As it's a DefModExtension and only called 
when products are actually produced, impact should be minimal.

Happy producing!
