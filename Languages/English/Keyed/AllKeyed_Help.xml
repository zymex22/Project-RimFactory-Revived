<!--       We don't actually use this, I believe?  The paperclip factory isn't implemented anywhere anymore.
  <PaperclipFactory_HelpText>The EMC factory doesn't just take in steel - it can make EMC from any item by manipulating its subatomic structure. The number of EMC produced is equivalent to 1/4 of the combined mass of the ingredients.</PaperclipFactory_HelpText>
  <PaperclipFactory_OrdoText><![CDATA[<b>Ordo Historia Standardization Archive - OHS 15616 - A paperclip used as feedstock for a standard atomic 3d printing device(OHS 6011)</b>
Section 1.1 - Physical properties
- A single paperclip must weigh 1.0 Â± 1*10^-8 grams.
- It can be made out of any form of matter, including exotic matter(OHS 11279) such as Dalekanium, Unobtainium or Vibranium; however, the end product has to exhibit the properties of a metal such that it is pliable, ductile and malleable.
- Paperclips must have a positive real mass.
- For instructions about how to manufacture a paperclip, see the Lantz-Foddy method for producing paperclips from matter(OHS 58281)

  <PRFPaperclipPowerGenerator_HelpText>The EMC power generator is just like a normal power generator, except it runs off EMC and has 2 extra features:\n1. You can adjust the fuel consumption rate to ramp up/down the power production.\n2. After unlocking "EMC power generator: self-improvement" in research, power production efficiency can slowly ramp up, as long as the building has fuel and is powered at all times.</PRFPaperclipPowerGenerator_HelpText>
  <AtomicReconstructor_HelpText>The atomic reconstructor turns EMC into items. Simply fuel it up, add power, set the item you want to produce and wait. You can also make it work faster by adjusting the slider. Note that the speed is directly proportional to the square of the EMC cost, for example if you set the speed to 2x, it will use 4x more EMC.\n\nGenerally, items that are more expensive take longer to make, and items that are heavier cost more EMC.\n\nNote: The atomic reconstructor cannot make any items that have to be made from a material (for example, steel longsword)</AtomicReconstructor_HelpText>
  <PRFPaperclipDuplicator_HelpText>Think of the EMC duplicator as a bank: it stores EMC and gives you a set interest on those EMC. The Duplicator tab provides an interface for you to deposit/withdraw EMC. Note that you need to provide a cargo platform as an item source for depositing/withdrawing EMC.\n\nThe formula that is used for calculating the current EMC amount is:\nCurrentBalance = 1.05^(DaysPassed) * InitialBalance</PRFPaperclipDuplicator_HelpText>

  <PRF_DigitalStorageUnit_I_HelpText>The Digital Storage Unit (DSU) functions like any other storage building, except all items put inside are moved to the middle cell, allowing for virtually infinite storage capacity. Thereâs a limit defined in mod settings, and if set too high it might cause lag.\n\nTo prevent considerable lag in heavily used cargo platforms, the item readout in the "Items" tab only displays the first 500 items. You can, however, search for the item you want using the search bar.\n\nNOTE: To output to crates and cargo platforms with the "Industrial Rollers" mod, remember to use a roller pusher at the end.\nTo set direct DSU output right-click the desired output item in the DSU item list to have it move to the DSU output cell. \nYou can also right click and select a pawn and force wear to equip items from storage\n\n The Pawn Access button controls whether pawns can directly interact with the DSU or if they have to use the I/O port.</PRF_DigitalStorageUnit_I_HelpText>
  <PRF_IOPort_I_HelpText>To configure the storage unit I/O port, set the mode (input or output), and the unit you want to connect to.

  <!--================================ Belts and pullers ==============================-->
  <PRF_Conveyor_Simple_I_HelpText>Conveyor belts will send items along their path. They automatically connect to other belts, including other belts facing different directions, excluding belts facing each other. You can split stacks or selectively filter items to other belts using belt splitters (so long as the belt and splitter are both above or below ground). Linking above and below ground belts requires a subterranean entrance or exit, but pullers do not require this conversion regardless of their position.\n\n Belts are not sophisticated, they will shove the objects into any empty space in front of it, including storage containers and stockpiles. They also do not obey filter settings, this function requires using pullers.\n\nYou can set any segment as the "end belt" in settings to make the item stop in order to be used by an assembler, this does not require a shelf or hopper.</PRF_Conveyor_Simple_I_HelpText>
  <PRF_Conveyor_Wall_I_HelpText>Wall conveyor belts function similarly to standard conveyor belts except that they keep rooms insulated from one another. They work in conjunction with all puller types and link seamlessly with standard belts. You can direct their output into storage without using a puller.</PRF_Conveyor_Wall_I_HelpText>
  <PRF_Conveyor_UG_I_HelpText>Underground belts are capable of going under machinery and walls without issue. However, they do not interact with standard belts unless linked with subterranean entrances and exits. Underground belts also require the use of a puller or subterranean exit in order to retrieve items from underground. Keep in mind that splitters must also match: Above ground belts use above ground splitters, and underground belts use underground splitters.</PRF_Conveyor_UG_I_HelpText>
  <PRF_Conveyor_Connector_To_UG_HelpText>Underground entrance: Required for use to merge standard belts with underground belts, however they are not required in order to iniate any length of underground belt. In other words, you can link an above ground puller directly to standard underground belt to send it underground.</PRF_Conveyor_Connector_To_UG_HelpText>
  <PRF_Conveyor_Connector_To_Floor_HelpText>Underground exit: Required by underground belts in order to exit or interact with above ground storage, stockpiles, and belts. Without an exit, an unterminated underground belt will carry items until something pulls it or another section of underground belt is added.</PRF_Conveyor_Connector_To_Floor_HelpText>
  <PRF_Conveyor_Splitter_I_HelpText>Conveyer belt splitters work by splitting or filtering objects on a belt into two or three other directions. To do this, face the splitter away from your current belt then enable the output directions in settings. Each direction must be selected then enabled, and each direction has their own sets of filters. For instance: You can select North, enable North, and only select "chunks", then select and enable East, selecting everything but chunks. This would effectively filter any amount of chunks to the North, and the belt would continue East. With everything selected, the splitter splits stacks. With nothing selected, the splitter holds items.</PRF_Conveyor_Splitter_I_HelpText>

  <PRF_FuelingMachine_HelpText>The fueling machine is quite easy to use. Point the robotic arm designated by the yellow cell at the structure you want to fuel, place fuel next to it in the white cells and give it power.\nRefuels most standard refuelables.\nIt is also capable of fueling mortars and some modded mortars/turrets.\n(Supports CE turrets and SoS Torpedos)</PRF_FuelingMachine_HelpText>
  <PRF_SimplePuller_I_HelpText>A simple item puller, slower than later versions.\n\nIt can pull from belts, crates, DSU, stockpile zones, shelves, and smart hoppers. Is toggled off by default and requires being activated in order to function. Not required to terminate a belt into storage, but can help with more advanced logic. To get better control, set filters and settings. By default, pullers will not output if item is not allowed in target destination or if output is blocked by a wall or another item.\n\nYellow cell = output\nWhite cell = input.</PRF_SimplePuller_I_HelpText>
  <PRF_GrowzonePuller_I_HelpText>Works similarly to other pullers, but this one only is able to pull from growzones.</PRF_GrowzonePuller_I_HelpText>

  <PRF_SimplePuller_II_Side_HelpText>An angled puller that works at 90 degree angles. Has similar features to the standard puller, with yellow cells as output and white cells as input. The direction can be changed after placing.Might be usefull in some cases</PRF_SimplePuller_II_Side_HelpText>

  <PRF_SmartHopper_HelpText>The Smart Hopper pulls in nearby items from the ground or stockpile cells onto itself and holds until an assembler can use it.\n\n If you want to use it on an assembler, remember to enable the assembler's "toggle allow forbidden" option to allow assembler to pull from the hopper.</PRF_SmartHopper_HelpText>
