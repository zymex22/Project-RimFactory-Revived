    <discoveredLetterTitle>About: Factory building</discoveredLetterTitle>
    <discoveredLetterText>Welcome to Project RimFactory Beta!
      /n/nWe invite you on a trip through the ages of automation from the root of fueled smelters through to self-improving assemblers.
      /nStore materials in the white designation for the machine to consume. After a bit of work, the machine will place the finished product on it's Output tile.
      /n/nThe oldest known clockwork machine is the Antikythera mechanism, found in 1901 in a shipwreck dated at 50BC and Greek in origin. A series of 30 gears used to predict eclipses and other astronomical phenomenon as well as the passage of years.

    <discoveredLetterText>Leonard Euler developed mathematical systems for interactions between physics, geometry and algebra.
      \nWith these formulas, automated production of basic materials such as stone bricks and simple art is possible.

    <discoveredLetterText>The mathematical models developed in the 1700s began an industrial revolution all of the world, series of gears and pressurization allowed the mass processing of basic materials with coal and electricity. 
      /nMoritz von Jacobi managed to propel a boat with an electric motor in 1845, but it wasn't until 1837 when Thomas and Emily Dacenport patented the first motor in the US that the promise of electro-mechanical machinery was seen as the next big leap forward
      /nRudimentary programming allows storing a bill on a Recipe Database and importing it into an assembler.
      /n-The blue region around assemblers and recipe databases indicate the data transfer area
