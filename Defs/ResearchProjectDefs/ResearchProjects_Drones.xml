    <discoveredLetterTitle>About: Drone are now lv 10</discoveredLetterTitle>
    <discoveredLetterText>You now have basic knowledge about drones and can now start to utilize them for different tasks. This also unlocks Drone Cultivator research which lets you Automate your agriculture needs. \n This will set any drones base level to 10. \n Unless other settings for specific dronestation is specified.</discoveredLetterText>
