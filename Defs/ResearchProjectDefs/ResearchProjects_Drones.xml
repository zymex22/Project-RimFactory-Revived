    <discoveredLetterTitle>About: Drone are now lv 10</discoveredLetterTitle>
    <discoveredLetterText>You now have basic knowledge about drones and can now start utilize them for different tasks. This also unlocks DroneCultivator research which let you Automate your agriculture needs. \n This will set any drones base level to 10. \n Unless other settings for specific dronestation is specified.</discoveredLetterText>
