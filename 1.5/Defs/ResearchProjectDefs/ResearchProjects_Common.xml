    <description>Early industrialization, teaches you how to set up a more advanced way of gathering resources and process them into more useful things. Trash, raw materials, or scrap metal goes in one side and useful products come out the other.\nThese very early devices are made with cogs and chutes and are powered by wood and coal.</description>

    <discoveredLetterTitle>Early automation</discoveredLetterTitle>
    <discoveredLetterText>Welcome to Project RimFactory Beta!\n\nWe invite you on a trip through automation, starting with wood and coal-fueled smelters and advancing through AI-controlled self-improving assemblers.\n\nGeneral Usage: Store materials in the white designation input area for the machine to consume. After a bit of work, the machine will place the finished product on its yellow output tile.\n\nThe oldest known clockwork machine is the Antikythera mechanism, found in 1901 in a shipwreck dated 50 BC and Greek in origin. A series of 30 gears was used to predict eclipses and other astronomical phenomena as well as the passage of years. Advanced clockwork mechanisms reached new heights in Europe during the 1800s, and even today automation without computers is used in industry.\n\nCode by:spdskatr, Nobo, Abnerchen, Little White Mouse, Madara Uchiha, Sn1p3rr3c0n.\nArt by: ShotgunFrenzy, Chicken Plucker, Xen, Scythe, totoBrother, "Unknown Alien", Argon, spdskatr, Thornsworth.\nTested by Malkav, Extrien, Daemon976, AerosAtar, and the mandatory Steam volunteers.\nTranslated by: Natsu_Zirok, 十里小飞, AbnerChen, Lucas559-noob.\nSpecial thanks Thornsworth and Nobo, who are no longer with us.\nRest In Productivity.</discoveredLetterText>

    <discoveredLetterText>The mathematical models developed in the 1700s began an industrial revolution all over the world, a series of gears and pressurization allowed the mass processing of basic materials with coal and electricity.\nMoritz von Jacobi managed to propel a boat with an electric motor in 1845, but it wasn't until 1837 when Thomas and Emily Davenport patented the first motor in the US that the promise of electro-mechanical machinery was seen as the next big leap forward.\nRudimentary programming allows storing a bill on a recipe database and importing it into an assembler.\nThe blue region around assemblers and recipe databases indicates the data transfer area.</discoveredLetterText>
